# Learning Sessions Browser

A small UI for browsing short AI learning sessions.  
Built with **Vue 3 + Pinia + TypeScript** in under the 90-minute assignment window.

The app loads session data from `sessions.json`, supports searching and sorting, and includes loading/error states with retry and accessibility considerations.
